# Prework Study Guide Webpage
UCONN coding bootcamp pre-work project

## Description

This project is a sample web application giving the boot camp student the step-by step experience of creating an HTML document, connecting an external stylesheet (CSS), adding functionality with JavaScript, and deploying to the web.

While I have some experience in web development and have done some studying on my own, this pre-bootcamp project gave me the opportunity to set up tools and accounts, fill in gaps in my knowledge and to create a final demonstrative product in a short time. Following the bootcamp instructions also presented the opportunity to use current best practices, not just the habits I acquired on my own in one particular production environment. 

For example, I have been in the habit of using Terminal within VS Code, rather than the standalone terminal program.  At this point, I still prefer using the terminal in VS Code. One pitfall for me is that if I create files and navigate using the terminal, I have to remember to navigate back to the top level directory of the project before adding and committing changes, or Git only applies the changes within that sub-directory.  What a mess that makes!
